# Social Media Addiction Analytics Dashboard

This project presents an interactive data visualization dashboard designed to explore patterns in social media usage and addiction among students. Using survey data from 705 respondents, the dashboard enables users to examine relationships between daily usage hours, sleep duration, mental health scores, academic performance, and preferred platforms.

The dashboard is intended for school administrators, counselors, and students seeking to better understand digital behavior and its impact on well-being and academic outcomes. Through interactive filtering and comparative visualizations, users can identify high-risk groups and support evidence-based digital wellness interventions.
